# Poke-Go-Finder
This repository was designed to request the [server app](https://github.com/Unknowncmbk/Pokemon-Go-Locator-Server), which allowed users to retrieve cached data requests from the Server. This would allow users to zoom out on their Google Maps view and see Pokemon from miles away.

## Requirements
- iOS 10.x.x
